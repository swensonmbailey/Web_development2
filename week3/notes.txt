Objects
    Object methods
        How to declare an object method:
            user = {
                sayHi: function() {
                    alert("Hello");
                }
            };

            Shorthand declaration:
                user = {
                    sayHi() { 
                        alert("Hello");
                    }
                };
        Question: What are the differences between the shorthand and the normal form? (the reading said there was a difference in relation to inheritance)

    "this" refers to the current object. It's how the program gets the object to reffernce its own stored data.
        Its important to use "this" because it makes it were you can create multiple of the same objects and also better use inheritance
        "If there’s this inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context."
            Don't use it outside of the context of an object.
        in javascript "this" is unbound and what it reffernces is determined at call-time.
            this is good for reusing methods for multiple objects.
        Question: what does the "this" global object do?
    
Objects
    - "a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions. If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method."
    in a way js objects are like js maps.
    objects are mutable at all times. Even if its declaration used "const"


    the "in" opperator is used to check to see if an object as a certain property
        to avoid inheritance mix ups use the "hasOwnProperty()" method
    you can loop through an object's properties with a for in loop
    
    objects in Javascript don't require a class.

    an objects properties can be looped through with the for in loop.
    Question: is looping through an object common practice?
    when would this be practical?

    objects can nest other objects.
        topObcject.nestedObject.property 
    
    "An important concept to get your head around is that objects are assigned by reference. This means that if a variable is assigned to an object that already exists, it will simply point to the exact same space in memory. So any changes made using either reference will affect the same object."

    Question: is there away to easily create a new object from an existing one without have to loop through the existing object's properties one at a time?

    "An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is useful when there are a large number of parameters, as it allows the arguments to be provided by name and in any order"

    Question: Are there any in other ways to turn objects into strings or is Json the only one.

    Question: The date object has getter methods. I remember in one of my python classes that it was good practice to us getter and setter methods. Is that true for JS?

document.
    Question: is there a preferred what to interact/access things on from the document or is manily programmer's preferrence? I.E. queryselector getelementbyid etc...

    In querySelctors can you use CSS psuedo-elements?

    .childNodes - be catuious because this will return all nodes including whitespace.
    .children - a better property to use becuase it won't return nodes of whitespace.

    .classList.add() .classList.remove() .classList.toggle() .classList.contains()


events
    addEventListenr() can be used on a node object (html element)
    it's best not to use inline event listners
