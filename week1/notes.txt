What I learned from the reading:
    when retreiving input always use .value
    when displaying output always use the .innterHTML

    local storage is pretty easy to use in javascript:
        in order to save a variable to the local storage use localStorage.setItem(key, value)
        local storage stores items in key value pairs, similar to a dictory/js object;
        in order to retrieve an item from the local storage use localStorage.getItem(key);
        ....
        local storage is also  an associative array:
            instead of using the function getItem, I can simply use localStorage[key]
            instead of using the function setItem I can simply use localStorage[key] = value
            
            Because local storage is an associative array a key can only hold one value:
                The way arround this is to use Json which can convert (stringify) arrays and javascript objects in or a single string.
                In order to use the storaged array/object you must first parse (split up the one string).
Questions: 
    Can I do the same thing with these associative properities where instead of typing the string I send a varable that has the key as a value?
    What other things can be stringified into Json?
    Can localStorage store images, mp3, or video? Is it just text?
            

What I learned form the videos:
    Mobile first
        Start small and scale up!
            Start building for mobile and then upscale for larger screens.
    
    Master mobile UX:
        Speed is key. Your UI should allow people to find/do the important things quick. If it takes too long they might leave the site.
        Place is also important when talking about mobile UI:
            People use smartphones one handed, so things should be easily reached when using a phone one handed.
            
        Make your website faster:
            minify css and js files
            use smaller image formats

        Make your website simple:
            simple is leads to more conversions
Questions:
    What about left handed people? Do we design with the majority in mind alone?
    How do I minify css and js files? Is there a quick and easy way to do it?
    I was always under the impression that for an image to look good it had to be a bigger file. How are websites suppose to mantain image quality by using smaller file formats?
